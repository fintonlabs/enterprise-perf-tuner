2. **pip**: pip is a package manager for Python. It is used to install and manage software packages/libraries written in Python. If you have Python version 3.4 or later, pip is included by default.

3. **Flask**: Flask is a lightweight web application framework. It is used to create the web interface for this tool.

4. **psutil**: This is a cross-platform library used to access system details and process utilities. It is used in this tool to fetch the performance metrics.

## Installation Process

Follow the steps below to install and run the performance tuning tool:

1. **Install Flask and psutil**:

You can install Flask and psutil using pip. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
pip install flask psutil
```

2. **Clone the Project**:

Clone the project repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of the repository containing the project.

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

Change your current directory to the project directory:

```bash
cd <project_directory>
```

## Verification

To verify that the application is running correctly:

1. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`. You should see the application's user interface.

2. Monitor the terminal for any error messages. If the application is running correctly, you should not see any errors.

## Post-Installation Configuration

No further configuration is required after installing this application. However, if you want to monitor disk usage for a specific directory other than the root directory, you can modify the `update_metrics` method in the `PerformanceMonitor` class.

Change this line:

```python
self.disk_usage = psutil.disk_usage('/').percent
```

to:

```python
self.disk_usage = psutil.disk_usage('<directory_path>').percent
```

Replace `<directory_path>` with the path to the directory you want to monitor.

# Usage Guide for Performance Tuning Tool

This guide provides comprehensive instructions on how to use the performance tuning tool written in Python. The tool monitors the application performance in real-time and suggests adjustments for enterprise workloads.

## 1. Basic Usage

To use the PerformanceMonitor class, you first need to create an instance of the class. The instance will automatically initialize all metrics (CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, network usage) to zero.

```python
monitor = PerformanceMonitor()
```

To update the metrics, you need to call the `update_metrics()` method on the instance.

```python
monitor.update_metrics()
```

After calling `update_metrics()`, the metrics are updated with the current system usage. You can access these metrics through the instance variables `cpu_usage`, `memory_usage`, `disk_usage`, and `network_usage`.

```python
print(f"CPU usage: {monitor.cpu_usage}%")
print(f"Memory usage: {monitor.memory_usage}%")
print(f"Disk usage: {monitor.disk_usage}%")
```

## 2. Common Use Cases

One common use case is to monitor the system performance over a period of time. This can be done by calling `update_metrics()` in a loop and printing the metrics at each iteration.

```python
for _ in range(10):
    monitor.update_metrics()
    print(f"CPU usage: {monitor.cpu_usage}%")
    print(f"Memory usage: {monitor.memory_usage}%")
    print(f"Disk usage: {monitor.disk_usage}%")
    time.sleep(1)
```

This script will print the CPU, memory and disk usage every second for 10 seconds.

## 3. Command-line Arguments

Currently, this tool does not support command-line arguments.

## 4. Expected Output Examples

The output of the tool will look something like this when `update_metrics()` is called and the results are printed:

```
CPU usage: 12.8%
Memory usage: 45.6%
Disk usage: 76.4%
```

These values represent the current system usage in percentages.

## 5. Advanced Usage Scenarios

For advanced usage, you can extend the `PerformanceMonitor` class and add more metrics or features. For example, you can add a method that logs the metrics to a file.

```python
class LoggablePerformanceMonitor(PerformanceMonitor):
    def log_metrics(self, filename):
        with open(filename, 'a') as f:
            f.write(f"CPU: {self.cpu_usage}, Memory: {self.memory_usage}, Disk: {self.disk_usage}\n")

monitor = LoggablePerformanceMonitor()
monitor.update_metrics()
monitor.log_metrics('metrics.log')
```

This extended class will write the metrics to a file called `metrics.log` each time `log_metrics()` is called.

# Performance Tuning Tool - API Documentation

## Class: PerformanceMonitor

### Description:

PerformanceMonitor is a class that monitors the system's performance in real-time, including CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, and network usage. All these metrics are represented as percentages.

### Attributes:

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| cpu_usage | float | Represents the current CPU usage as a percentage. |
| memory_usage | float | Represents the current memory usage as a percentage. |
| disk_usage | float | Represents the current disk usage as a percentage. |
| network_usage | float | Represents the current network usage as a percentage. |

### Methods:

#### 1. `__init__()`

This method initializes an instance of the PerformanceMonitor class. It doesn't require any parameters.

Usage example:
```python
monitor = PerformanceMonitor()
```

#### 2. `update_metrics()`

This method updates the performance metrics of the system. It doesn't require any parameters and doesn't return any value. It updates the attributes `cpu_usage`, `memory_usage`, and `disk_usage` with the current system's CPU, memory, and disk usage, respectively.

Usage example:
```python
monitor = PerformanceMonitor()
monitor.update_metrics()
```

After running `update_metrics()`, you can access the updated metrics through the instance attributes:
```python
print(monitor.cpu_usage)       # Prints the current CPU usage
print(monitor.memory_usage)    # Prints the current memory usage
print(monitor.disk_usage)      # Prints the current disk usage
```

## Best Practices:

- Always create a new instance of PerformanceMonitor class before monitoring system performance.
- Call `update_metrics()` at regular intervals to get the most recent system performance metrics.
- Access the metrics through the instance attributes (`cpu_usage`, `memory_usage`, `disk_usage`) after calling `update_metrics()`.

## Error Handling:

If an error occurs while fetching the system's performance metrics (e.g., due to lack of permissions), a `psutil.Error` will be raised. You should handle this exception in your code.

Example:
```python
try:
    monitor = PerformanceMonitor()
    monitor.update_metrics()
except psutil.Error as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

## Future Enhancements:

Currently, the `network_usage` attribute is declared but not utilized. Future versions will include network usage monitoring as well.
